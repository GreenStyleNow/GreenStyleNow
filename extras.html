<p1>I’ve been working on this Gundam set on and off for quite awhile. I got interested in gundam last summer through

<p1>As stated in the crafts section, I am here to speak more on the circumstances of the new gift I have cultivated. During March we had a trip at my school to go to an arcade and we did laser tag too.

<p1>I have been less consistent in entries recently but I think that is very exemplary of the general situation of someone living in modern society. I imagine my workload will continue to grow as I get older since when it has continued to do that until this point. I suppose that should make me more grateful for the free time I have right now and I am, I believe I stay active and creative within the pockets of freedom in my schedule. Maybe over time I will either not or I will gaslight myself that I do not have enough time to do things like this: writing in a tiny passion project of mine. Sometimes I wish I had the option to or was born into living a very simple life in a place and point in time where this would be a sustainable lifestyle without having to go off the grid. For years I’ve been very drawn to the idea of growing up in a small town and knowing that when I got older I would work in my family's business in some way shape or form. Now, I bet that in this state of the world we could go bankrupt or have to cut corners to attempt staying afloat so I guess it really isn’t all that desirable. If I went off the grid right now then maybe I could escape to that fate. I would enjoy the idea of being able to completely sustain myself by myself but in all truth I don’t think I currently have the skills needed to unleash that greatness upon the world. I believe the main thing that draws me to this scenario is that I would be devoid of the worries of modern stressors like having so much control over my social mobility. This has all been somewhat changed as I became more sure of what profession I’d like to work towards. Knowing what goal to have definitely makes it a lot easier to achieve. But still,

<p1>This is purely something I found interesting that I thought would be nice to share. A few nights ago I had a dream in which I escaped from vaguely European spies, became a fraud pigeon princess, and found myself well liked by the general public while parading in this costume of an identity. In it I remember bringing up how birds would love to be educated but can’t due to the fact there are no teachers their size. I also sang Big Star by Thirteen poorly for my adoring fans. I mostly remember the mediocrity of my attempt at the line “would you be an outlaw for my love”. It was also, oddly enough, very picturesque and slightly reminiscent of the movie “The Color of Pomegranates”.
<div></div>
Now of course I will attempt to connect it to the main focus of this blog: sustainability and environmental issues.

<p1>To not give up what makes you yourself you must rely on yourself. This leads to you gaining full satisfaction. You decide what's right and wrong to you by exploring it as you should do with everything. Don’t trust the well believed truth for you must search for it by yourself. Conforming to society by accepting what is spoon fed to you intellectually doesn’t bring you individual solace, you're just attempting to be well liked. In this you fail to be a person who is righteous and respected by your ownself as you solely follow the ideals of outsiders. By sticking to what you trust through searching yourself through topics you can find a truth that resonates with you. For example, the man who first believed in the actual intricate shape of snowflakes, continental drift leading us away from pangea, and weather having the ability to be predicted were not believed or paraded by society in their time. Lise Meitner, a Swedish physician, was not renowned whatsoever for her discovery of Nuclear Fission and instead her coworker was because she proudly was knowledgeable whilst female and Jewish. In this she, as did all the other scientists, denied societal conformity in knowing they found something they believed in through their exploration and studies. Even if no one else believed in it or them. To live your own life you must go against the social contract and reject conformity. Again, as Emerson stated, “Whoso would be a man must be a nonconformist”. Being that living successfully requires not following all of the ideals of one's society detailed in the contract, it is justifiable to live fully and thus disrespect it.

<p1>Summer is coming- I mean Spring is coming first but Summer is surely nigh! Due to that I’ve been working on applications for Summer programs. This entry is somewhat unusual as there isn’t any grand reason why this is morally wrong or right (This line is now making me think of the PIL song “Rise”). This has provided me time to think about where all of this is going. </p1>

<p1>I am the co-founder of what I hope to file soon as a nonprofit! I am finding some complications though in raising enough cash to start one. For now, I will share some details about the nonprofit. It is called The Golden Grove, which , although catchy, doesn’t make too much sense if viewed in a literal sense because we will surely not be interacting with trees. Our mission is to grow produce in community gardens, boosting community engagement, and donate our produce to underprivileged communities. I’ve been rummaging through the NY site of how to certify a nonprofit but I am moderately confused about where and how I should be sending the Certificate of Incorporation. I’ll probably ask someone for help later because asking for help is important (unheard of opinion)! Anyways, stay well!

<p1>I partake in thrifting. I do have to admit that this isn’t purely because of my thoughtful desire of not being wasteful but rather that I like a lot of brands that just don’t sell stuff anymore: thrift shops have become my treasure trove. Be it a certain vintage silhouette, Lanvin before they attempted being hip, True Religion low waisted jeans, Pukpuk graphic art reflecting the modernity of 3-D art in the 90’s, or an incredibly aged If Six Was Nine garment: I want it and I truly can not find it in a not second hand state. The cheaper price makes this all the more better and the beaten in grooves strangely enough make clothing more desirable to wear to me as they are more comfortable to exist in. I think this view on thrifted clothes is getting more popular too because I’ve seen a decent number of youtube thumbnails showcasing young women telling you their thrifting secrets. As someone who’s been victim to not knowing what to watch but was very well aware of my conviction to watch, this is with either a focus on how you must always check the cleanliness of the items you’re buying or how to find the most desirable pieces to you. I feel like both of those should be pretty easily answered points that can be said in less than a minute but that isn’t the focus of this entry. It’s somewhat funny to me to reflect on the older view of thrifted clothing. I’ve watched my fair share of my beloved questionable late 1990’s to early 2000’s comedy movies and adult swim shows in that same time frame and I can’t think of an instance in which someone having to wear old clothes was anything more than a depressing symbol of their lacking familial wealth. I guess it’s more of the idea that they ‘have to’ rather than today where it’s seen as almost a hobby, linked with the idea of being ‘chique’. I was reminded of this yesterday when I visited Brooklyn. Besides from deep Brooklyn, I have a strong belief that the land mass is filled with hipsters. This feels like an almost clear truth with the amount of thrift shops, coffee shops, niche hobby stores, and vegan restaurants littered about Greenpoint and Williamsburg. I don’t have anything personally against hipsters but I wouldn’t exactly label myself a fan (even though, besides being vegan, I have many overlapping characteristics). Whilst there I obtained three new thrifted articles of clothing to better combat the cold that I never dress well enough against. On Tuesday I was on the street with a friend of mine for an hour, fiercely struggling against the weather. Only when my hands and knees felt numb and my ears were practically neon red did I realize that wearing skinny jeans, a light jacket, and a turtleneck on a day that was 10F (about -12C for all the metric system users)a truly impractical idea. Anyways, that urged me to take on heavier clothing and like an unwanted rescue animal, it came to me in an elderly and unique state. Just like one, I’ll still love it anyways. Unlike a senior rescue animal, my thick jacket won’t be leaving me any time soon. In fact, I fear it may surpass me for it still looks lovely and lacks damage. This all goes to show that you consider thrifting. You can be like me, get it for style or just to protect you in whatever weather you’re battling. There are many great garments to be found and all of them do not consist of cheap fabric and underpaid third world country residing workers.  Go find pieces that preside among others and are made for long usage, find ones that don’t waste the materials that were used to create them. Not only will this save money (which may not matter to everyone seeing as I watched a man burn some of his friends' money the other day, calmly chanting “die devil, die”) but it will make you more individually sustainable.
